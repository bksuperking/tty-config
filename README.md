# TTY::Config

> Define, read and write any Ruby app configurations with a penchant for terminal clients.

**TTY::Config** provides app configuration component for [TTY](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty) toolkit.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tty-config'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tty-config

## Usage

Initialize the configuration and provide the name:

```ruby
config = TTY::Config.new
config.filename = 'investments'
```

then configure values for different nested keys with `set` and `append`:

```ruby
config.set('settings', 'base', value: 'USD')
config.set('settings', 'color', value: true)
config.set('coins', value: ['BTC'])

config.append('ETH', 'TRX', 'DASH', to: 'coins')
```

get any value by using `fetch`:

```ruby
config.fetch('settings', 'base')
# => 'USD'

config.fetch('coins')
# => ['BTC', 'ETH', 'TRX', 'DASH']
```

and `write` configration out to `investments.yml`:

```ruby
config.write
# =>
# ---
# settings:
#   base: USD
#   color: true
# conins:
#  - BTC
#  - ETH
#  - TRX
#  - DASH
```

and then to read and `investments.yml` file, you need to provide the locations to search in:

```ruby
config.append_path Dir.pwd
config.append_path Dir.home
```

Finally, read in configuration back again:

```ruby
config.read
```
